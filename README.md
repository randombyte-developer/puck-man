#PuckMan

A school project in Java with [Greenfoot](greenfoot.org). I work with a one team member together. We have 6 * 1,5h in school and we can work at home. I just upload this to keep track of the progress and to share this code with my team member. The big commits from work in school will be named like 'First lesson', 'Second lesson'...
Almost all things are named in German because this is only for school.
